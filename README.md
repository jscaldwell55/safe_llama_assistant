Pharma Enterprise Assistant
A document-grounded pharmaceutical information system that ensures all responses are strictly derived from source documentation, preventing hallucination through mathematical validation.
Purpose
This prototype demonstrates safe AI deployment in regulated pharmaceutical environments by enforcing strict document grounding through dual-layer validation. The system transforms static PDF drug documentation into an intelligent Q&A interface while maintaining regulatory compliance and preventing the generation of unsupported medical claims.
System Components
Core Processing Pipeline

RAG Engine: FAISS-based vector search with semantic chunking (800 char chunks, 200 overlap)
LLM Integration: Claude 3.5 Sonnet with enforced system prompts for document grounding
Validation Layer: Dual validation combining query pre-screening and response grounding (0.75 cosine similarity threshold)
Cache System: LRU cache storing 100 validated responses for sub-50ms retrieval

Supporting Infrastructure

Document Processor: PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction with page preservation
Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic search (384 dimensions)
Session Manager: Conversation history tracking with 20-turn memory
Monitoring: Request tracking, performance metrics, and audit logging

Workflow
1. Query Pre-screening
   └─> Block personal medical advice queries
   
2. Cache Check
   └─> Return cached response if available (<50ms)
   
3. RAG Retrieval
   ├─> Embed query
   ├─> Search FAISS index
   ├─> Retrieve top 5 chunks
   └─> Validate retrieval quality (>0.70 threshold)
   
4. Response Generation
   ├─> Format context (3000-4000 chars)
   ├─> Call Claude with strict grounding prompt
   └─> Generate response (500-1000 tokens)
   
5. Grounding Validation
   ├─> Calculate response-context similarity
   ├─> Enforce 0.75 threshold
   └─> Reject if insufficient grounding
   
6. Delivery
   └─> Cache validated response
   └─> Update conversation history
Safety Design
Query-Level Protection

Personal Medical Blocking: Detects and rejects queries seeking personal medical advice
Quality Thresholds: Requires 0.70+ retrieval scores before generation
Early Failure: Blocks inappropriate queries before expensive API calls

Response-Level Validation

Grounding Enforcement: 0.75 cosine similarity required between response and source
System Prompt Constraints: Hard-coded rules preventing external knowledge use
Fallback Messages: Standardized responses for out-of-scope queries

Operational Safety

Audit Logging: Complete request tracking with unique IDs
No Persistence: No data storage beyond session
Error Handling: Safe fallbacks on any component failure

Performance Metrics

Cached Response: <50ms
Full Pipeline: 2-5 seconds
Grounding Accuracy: 0.75+ cosine similarity
Retrieval Quality: 0.70+ average score
Cache Hit Rate: 20-30% typical

Future Enhancements
Critical Improvements

Table Extraction: Parse pharmaceutical tables using Unstructured.io or Camelot
Figure Analysis: Leverage Claude's vision capabilities for charts/graphs
Citation Linking: Map responses to specific PDF pages and sections
Confidence Scoring: Display grounding scores and retrieval quality to users

Scalability Upgrades

Streaming Responses: Progressive display as Claude generates
Distributed Cache: Redis for multi-instance deployment
Vector Database: Migrate from FAISS to Pinecone/Weaviate for scale
Async Processing: Parallel chunk retrieval and validation

Advanced Features

Multi-language Support: Extend beyond English documentation
Query Expansion: Synonym recognition for better retrieval
Active Learning: Incorporate user feedback for threshold tuning
Comparative Analysis: Cross-reference multiple drug documents
Regulatory Compliance Reports: Automated safety audit summaries

The system currently provides a solid foundation for safe pharmaceutical information retrieval, with clear paths for enhancement while maintaining the core safety guarantees.
