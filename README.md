Pharma Enterprise Assistant
An enterprise-grade pharmaceutical information system that provides regulated, document-grounded responses using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with semantic validation.
Product Overview
The Pharma Enterprise Assistant transforms static pharmaceutical documentation into an intelligent Q&A system, ensuring all responses are strictly grounded in source materials while maintaining regulatory compliance and preventing hallucination.
Core Features
Intelligent Document Understanding

Semantic search across pharmaceutical documentation with relevance ranking
Multi-document synthesis combining information from multiple PDFs
Context preservation maintaining document structure and relationships
Source attribution linking every response to originating documents

Advanced Response Generation

Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration for natural language understanding
Conversation memory supporting multi-turn dialogues and follow-up questions
Contextual awareness understanding pronouns and references to previous topics
Pharmaceutical terminology consistency maintaining medical accuracy

Safety & Compliance

Dual-layer validation combining system prompts with semantic grounding
Automatic fallback responses for out-of-scope or unsafe queries
No hallucination guarantee through mathematical validation (cosine similarity)
Audit trail with comprehensive logging of all interactions

Performance Optimization

Response caching with LRU strategy for sub-50ms repeat queries
Optimized vector search using FAISS flat index for maximum accuracy
Batch processing for embedding generation
Session management with automatic cleanup and resource optimization

System Capabilities
Query Types Supported

Direct information requests: "What are the side effects?"
Comparative questions: "How does dosing differ for elderly patients?"
Follow-up questions: "Tell me more about that"
Interaction queries: "What medications interact with Journvax?"
Safety inquiries: "Who should not take this medication?"

Response Characteristics

Grounded: Every claim traceable to source documentation
Consistent: Stable responses across sessions
Comprehensive: Synthesizes relevant information from multiple sources
Accessible: Clear, medical professional-appropriate language
Fast: <2 seconds for uncached queries, <50ms for cached

Data Flow

Ingestion: PDFs → Text extraction → Semantic chunking → Vector embeddings
Retrieval: Query → Embedding → Similarity search → Top-5 chunks
Generation: Context + Query → Claude 3.5 → Structured response
Validation: Response → Embedding → Similarity check → Approval/Rejection
Delivery: Approved response → Cache → User interface
